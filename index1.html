    <h1> Course Project Introduction </h1>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>1. Displaying All Stations of the City</h2>
        <p>The need to visualize all transit stations in Amravati City is critical for better urban planning and public convenience. This involves listing all stations clearly to allow users to comprehend the available transit options at a glance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>2. Platform for Viewing, Searching, and Filtering Stations</h2>
        <p>Users require an intuitive interface to search for stations based on specific criteria like proximity, accessibility, or station type. Filtering options enhance usability and ensure quick access to relevant station details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>3. Displaying Stations Using Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)</h2>
        <p>Graph traversal techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) help visualize and explore station connectivity effectively. These methods aid in presenting route networks comprehensively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>4. Sorting Stations by Proximity, Accessibility, or Connectivity</h2>
        <p>Travelers often prioritize stations based on their needs, such as distance, facilities, or network centrality. Implementing sorting mechanisms like heap sort ensures efficient arrangement and presentation of stations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>5. Maintaining Up-to-Date Data on Stations</h2>
        <p>Accurate and updated information about station names, coordinates, and other details is crucial for effective transit system management. Using structured data ensures seamless updates and efficient retrieval.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>6. Finding Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Commuters often need the quickest routes between stations, especially during emergencies or peak hours. Dijkstra's algorithm provides an optimized solution to calculate the shortest path dynamically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>7. Real-Time Crowd Management and Alerts</h2>
        <p>Overcrowding at stations can disrupt transit services. Real-time crowd management systems ensure balanced passenger distribution, reducing delays and improving the overall transit experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>8. Tourist-Friendly Navigation and Route Suggestions</h2>
        <p>Tourists face difficulties navigating unfamiliar transit systems. A user-friendly guide with suggested routes, key station highlights, and simplified navigation ensures a hassle-free experience for visitors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>9. Shortest Routes Among Stations Using Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Floyd-Warshall algorithm facilitates the calculation of shortest paths between all pairs of stations. This is particularly useful for transit planning and ensuring efficient route management in complex networks.</p>
